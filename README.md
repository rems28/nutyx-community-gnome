Contributions are welcome. If you don't know what it all about, please take the time to read the documentation at
http://www.nutyx.org/en/build-package.html
(version fran√ßaise)
http://www.nutyx.org/fr/build-package.html

It will explain you what's a collection, a git, a port, the tools around 'cards' etc

Have fun :)
